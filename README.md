# GOWebServer
GoServer is a production-grade HTTP web server built entirely from scratch in Go, implementing every layer from raw TCP sockets to complete HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocol support. This project demonstrates advanced network programming by bypassing Go's standard net/http library and working directly with Unix syscalls.
